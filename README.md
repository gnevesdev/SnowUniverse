# SnowUniverse
A game about orbits and the universe :ringed_planet:

[hadron13](https://github.com/hadron13) challenged me to make a game like [Orbiter's Challenge](https://omnes-ludos.itch.io/orbiters-challenge), created by himself. And I did.

# Building :hammer_and_wrench:
The game was tested on Windows, with MinGW and VC++ compilers. However, other compilers and platforms should work just fine.

You need to install the [SDL library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and download the source code. Then use your C or C++ compiler of choice to build the game. If using the Clang or MinGW compiler, `-O2` flag is recommended for redistribution.

Remember to report any bugs on the [issues](https://github.com/gnevesdev/SnowUniverse/issues) page.
